I created GeFx out of a hobby of mine and sort of desperation seeing the current state of c++'s graphic support. With the following realizations in mind: 
1. This language is mostly used (or at least motivated) in the context of graphic design and game-programming
2. Everyone new to the language should be enabled to train general use cases immediatley, without having to talk to the GPU directly
3. A lot of graphics libraries lack modern support, crucial functionality, and a motivated base of contributors - Why can not I draw a circle in SDL2?

With this project I aim at offering a simple, out of the box, user friendly alternative to other graphics APIS out there. MORE PEOPLE should be empowered to embrace the beauty of graphics programming. While this means, that some design compromises have to be made, supporting a wide range of optimization methods will certainly be one of the main goals.

DISCLAIMER: I am always looking forward to improving my code and am therefore open for any kind of constructive criticism or help.
When you read my code and see a mistake, then PLEASE bring my attention to it
