I created this project out of a hobby of mine and of desperation seeing the current state of c++'s graphic support. By reading a lot of stackoverflow comments and reviews
the impression sadly occured, that there has been (or is) a lot of elitism regarding graphics programming in c++. And that is dumb for various reason:
1. C++ is mostly used for graphics, so a ton of support should be natural
2. Everyone new to the language should be enabled to train general use cases immediatley, without having to talk to the GPU directly
3. A lot of graphics libraries lack modern c++ support, crucial functionality, and a motivated consumer base - Why can not I draw a circle in SDL2?

DISCLAIMER: I always want to guarantee the best quality possible and since I know, that my coding skills are far from perfect, I am looking forward to a lot of constructive criticism.
When you read my code and see a mistake, then PLEASE bring my attention to it - while talking like a normal human being and not a condescending asshole
